-CHOICE:
Docker

-REASON:
The reason behind choosing Docker over virtualBox is because I have heard more about docker and its broad and recently famous application and usage, regardless the fact that I never work with it previously. 

-EXPERIENCE:
>idea
It is quite tricky when the first time I tried to grasp about what docker actually is and how it works as I struggled to distinguish the detailed technical difference between docker (and its environment, i.e. container, deployment, etc) and virtual machine. Once the great idea behind Docker was finally understood, I proceeded with the installation with fun and excited on windows 10 home. 

>installation 
The installation process is quite straightforward as the tutorial provided by Docker is easy to follow and implement. 

>first action
installing first image and creating several containers made my understanding of Docker even more clear and with this practical work, the future idea of utilizing docker is in mind.
